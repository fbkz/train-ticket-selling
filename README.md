# train-ticket-selling
The very first application that I did after learning programming back in december 2016.

The main objective was to make a console application in C to sell tickets for a train that has two carriages - first and second class.
Each execution of the program represents a train journey. There are default prices, but at the beggining of each journey the application operator can adjust the prices accordingly.
The application will also need to visually represent the carriages, its occupation as well the revenue.
